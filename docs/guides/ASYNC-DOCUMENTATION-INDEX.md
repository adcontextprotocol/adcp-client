4. Reference [API Reference](./ASYNC-API-REFERENCE.md) for type safety

## üéØ Key Concepts Summary

### Handler-Controlled Flow
The new model puts input handlers at the center of async execution control:
- **Mandatory for input-required status**: No default behavior, explicit handling required
- **Rich context**: Full conversation history and helper methods
- **Flexible responses**: Direct answers, deferrals, or aborts

### Four Async Patterns
Clear semantics for different execution scenarios:
- **Completed (0-2s)**: Immediate results for fast operations
- **Working (2s-120s)**: Server processing with connection kept open
- **Submitted (hours-days)**: Long-running tasks with webhook notifications
- **Input Required**: Handler provides clarification responses

### Type-Safe Continuations
Structured objects for managing async operations:
- **DeferredContinuation**: Client needs time for human input
- **SubmittedContinuation**: Server needs time for processing
- **Built-in tracking**: Progress monitoring and completion waiting

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Checklist

### Basic Implementation
- [ ] Choose appropriate async pattern for your use case
- [ ] Implement input handler for agent interactions
- [ ] Handle TaskResult status types (completed/deferred/submitted)
- [ ] Add basic error handling for InputRequiredError

### Production Implementation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for all error types
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Set up webhook handling for submitted tasks
- [ ] Implement deferred task storage and resumption
- [ ] Add logging and observability
- [ ] Create handler testing strategies

### Advanced Implementation
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination patterns
- [ ] Business rule handlers with validation
- [ ] A/B testing and optimization strategies
- [ ] Circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- [ ] Memory management for long-running applications

## üîß Architecture Patterns

### Simple Request-Response
```typescript
const handler = createFieldHandler({ budget: 50000 });
const result = await agent.getProducts(params, handler);
```

### Human-in-the-Loop
```typescript
const result = await agent.getProducts(params, handler);
if (result.status === 'deferred') {
  const userInput = await getUserApproval(result.deferred.question);
  const final = await result.deferred.resume(userInput);
}
```

### Long-Running Processing
```typescript
const result = await agent.createMediaBuy(params, handler);
if (result.status === 'submitted') {
  const final = await result.submitted.waitForCompletion(60000);
}
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```typescript
const results = await client.allAgents().getProducts(params, handler);
const successful = results.filter(r => r.success);
```

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Pattern Usage**: Distribution of completed/working/submitted/deferred
- **Response Times**: Average execution time by pattern and agent
- **Error Rates**: InputRequired, Timeout, and Clarification errors
- **Handler Performance**: Execution time and success rates

### Health Monitoring
- **Agent Connectivity**: Regular health checks for all agents
- **Protocol Compliance**: Validation of ADCP spec adherence
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, conversation storage, task tracking

### Debug Information
- **Conversation Traces**: Full message history for debugging
- **Handler Execution**: Detailed logs of handler decisions
- **Task Lifecycle**: Status transitions and timing information

## ü§ù Support and Community

### Common Issues
- Review [Troubleshooting Guide](./ASYNC-TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md) for common problems
- Check agent-specific documentation for protocol differences
- Validate handler logic with different conversation scenarios

### Best Practices
- Follow patterns in [Handler Patterns Guide](./HANDLER-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md)
- Implement gradual migration as outlined in [Migration Guide](./ASYNC-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)
- Use production examples from [Real-World Examples](./REAL-WORLD-EXAMPLES.md)

### Contributing
- Report issues with specific error messages and context
- Share handler patterns and use cases
- Contribute improvements to documentation and examples
