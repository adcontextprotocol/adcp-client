# Seller Reporting Ledger

`@adcp/sdk/reporting/ledger` turns a conforming reporting source into durable seller-side Reliable Reporting Core. It is separate from the buyer-side `reconcileReporting` API.

## Recommended: install the lifecycle service

`createReliableReportingService` is the adapter-first production path. A
provider adapter supplies one bounded slice fetch and two immutable offering
descriptions; the service reuses the PostgreSQL ledger, source executor,
producer, handlers, and decisioning-platform account resolver.

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { PostgresReportingLedgerStore } from '@adcp/sdk/reporting/ledger';
import { createReliableReportingService } from '@adcp/sdk/reporting/service';
import { createAdcpServerFromPlatform } from '@adcp/sdk/server';

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
const store = new PostgresReportingLedgerStore(pool, {
  acknowledgeIsolatedDatabase: true,
});

const reporting = createReliableReportingService({
  store,
  adapters: {
    // These descriptions are immutable declarations owned by your adapter.
    gam: { sourceOffering: gamSourceOffering, deliveryOffering: gamDeliveryOffering,
      fetchSlice: (slice, ctx) => gam.fetchDeliverySlice(slice, ctx) },
  },
  contact: { name: 'Reporting operations', email: 'reporting@example.com' },
  automatedRecoveryWindowSeconds: 86_400,
  statusRetentionDays: 90,

  // `account` is the framework-resolved account, not request.account.
  resolveSource: account => ({
    adapterId: 'gam',
    sourceScope: { network_id: account.ctx_metadata.gam.networkId },
    sourceTimezone: account.ctx_metadata.gam.reportingTimezone,
  }),
  // Resolve from trusted commercial/account state. The result is frozen into
  // the generation and every obligation; no request-body fallback exists.
  resolveCurrency: account => account.ctx_metadata.gam.currency,
  // The authorization boundary for shared upstream networks: return only the
  // constituents this account may report on. Never echo the declaration.
  resolveCoverage: async account => ({
    constituents: await bookings.authorizedReportingConstituents(account.id),
  }),
  resolveConsumerId: ctx => {
    if (!ctx.agent) throw new Error('Authenticated buyer-agent registry required');
    return ctx.agent.agent_url;
  },
});

await pool.query(reporting.setup.migrations[0]);
const installedPlatform = reporting.install(platform);
const server = createAdcpServerFromPlatform(installedPlatform, serverOptions);

reporting.start({ intervalMilliseconds: 60_000, deploymentWide: true });
process.once('SIGTERM', () => void reporting.stop());
```

The service advertises Reliable Reporting Core only. An inline adapter cannot
turn on Managed Delivery, Reconciled Billing, receipts, webhook activity, or
reporting notifications. `sync_reporting_status` is advertised only when
`resolveConsumerId` is installed and the supplied ledger implements its
atomic consumer-status methods. Follow-up work adds those higher tiers; do not
place them in a manual capability override.

Install a buyer declaration after the account and its media-buy scope have
been authorized and resolved. `installConfiguration` intentionally accepts no
account, `sourceScope`, contract, timezone, currency, `constituents`, or
`mediaBuyIds` fields from the declaration. Pass the framework-resolved
`ctx.account`; trusted callbacks derive the remaining lineage. `resolveCoverage`
is the media-buy/package authorization boundary and must derive the denominator
from the resolved account: `sourceScope` may legitimately name a shared upstream
network, in which case the constituent list is the only thing keeping one
buyer's orders out of another buyer's report. `mediaBuyIds` is always derived
from the returned constituents, so a buyer-named order ID can never reach
`fetchSlice`. `expectedCurrency`, `expectedSourceTimezone`, and
`expectedMediaBuyIds` are optional assertions and fail closed on conflict.
The service rejects credential-shaped keys and `ctx_metadata` anywhere in the
returned `sourceScope`, then applies the source contract and existing ledger
immutability checks. Return the resulting secret-free configuration state from
your `sync_accounts` implementation.

For tenant-partitioned jobs, call `runCycle({ accountId })`, or configure
`start({ accountIds: [...] })`. Every planner and worker call receives that
same account boundary. A deployment-owned worker must explicitly pass
`deploymentWide: true`; use that form only when one trusted service instance is
authorized for every account in the store. Widening is reachable only through
that opt-in: a cycle with a missing, empty, or overlong `accountId` is refused
rather than silently promoted to a deployment-wide scan. Under `accountIds`,
one account's failed cycle is reported to `onError` and the remaining accounts
still run, so a persistently failing tenant cannot starve the tenants behind
it. Planning is resumable and bounded;
set `maxObligationsPerAccount` and `maxWorkerIterationsPerAccount` for tighter
operational limits. `stop()` aborts current source work, waits for settlement,
and wakes a sleeping scheduler immediately. Planning is a bounded ledger
operation rather than abortable source I/O, so shutdown waits for an in-flight
planning pass to settle and does not begin its worker afterward.

Run `runReliableReportingServiceConformanceV1` against an isolated test ledger
before deployment. It covers source replay, two-account isolation,
configuration replay/frozen currency, lifecycle start/stop, and Core
capability truthfulness.

## Advanced: assemble the primitives directly

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import {
  PostgresReportingLedgerStore,
  REPORTING_LEDGER_MIGRATION,
  sweepExpiredReportingLedgerState,
  createReportingDeliveryHandler,
  createReportingProducer,
  createReportingStatusHandler,
  createSyncReportingStatusHandler,
  type ReportingConsumerStatusLedgerStore,
} from '@adcp/sdk/reporting/ledger';

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await pool.query(REPORTING_LEDGER_MIGRATION);

const store = new PostgresReportingLedgerStore(pool, {
  acknowledgeIsolatedDatabase: true,
});
const producer = createReportingProducer({
  store,
  source,
  offerings,
  contact: { name: 'Reporting operations', email: 'reporting@example.invalid' },
});

const getReportingStatus = createReportingStatusHandler(store);
const getMediaBuyDelivery = createReportingDeliveryHandler(store);

// Run periodically from one or more bounded maintenance workers.
await sweepExpiredReportingLedgerState(pool);
```

Pass `getReportingStatus` and `getMediaBuyDelivery` directly to the matching `createAdcpServer` slots. The delivery helper serves only exact `reporting_revision_id` reads and returns the row payload bound by the ledger revision. Advertise `media_buy.reporting_delivery` in `experimental_features` together with a `media_buy.reporting_delivery` capability whose Reliable Reporting version is `1.0` only after both handlers are wired. Configure account resolution on the server: both handlers require the framework-resolved, caller-scoped account identity and never trust a request-body identity as an authorization boundary. If two callers can name the same upstream account, the resolver must issue distinct internal account IDs for their ledger namespaces. Install immutable delivery-configuration generations through `producer.installConfiguration`, call `planObligations()` after period close, and run `runWorker()` from a durable scheduler. Multiple workers are safe: PostgreSQL claims use `SKIP LOCKED`, expiring leases, and fencing generations.

The planner uses fixed millisecond periods and an explicitly frozen IANA source timezone. Calendar or billing-cycle schedules should be expanded by the seller into immutable period boundaries before installation; the SDK intentionally has no Temporal dependency. At period end, the obligation freezes the constituent denominator and coverage. A zero-row source object commits like any other revision. Absence remains an empty revision association. A deployment with per-tenant workers should pass the resolved `account_id` to both `planObligations()` and `runWorker()`; omitting it intentionally runs a deployment-wide worker.

### Migrating an existing manual lifecycle

Keep the same `PostgresReportingLedgerStore` and run the same
`REPORTING_LEDGER_MIGRATION`; there is no second store and no data migration.
Move each inline fetch plus its source/delivery offering into an entry in
`adapters`, move account routing and currency lookup into the two trusted
resolvers, and replace manual producer/handler/capability assembly with
`reporting.install(platform)`. Replace cron calls to `planObligations` and
`runWorker` with `runCycle` or `start`. Remove manual reporting capability
overrides so discovery has one owner. Existing configuration IDs and semantic
fingerprints remain compatible because the service delegates installation to
the existing producer: replaying a generation that predates the reserved
adapter route key reuses its stored `sourceScope` verbatim, so the fingerprint
still matches and the replay does not trip generation immutability. Only new
generations carry the reserved key. With one installed adapter, pre-service
obligations without the reserved adapter route continue through that sole
adapter. A
multi-adapter migration must create a new immutable configuration generation
with an explicit route. An adapter supplies exactly one of `fetchSlice` or
`executor`: `fetchSlice` is the inline boundary, and `executor` accepts any
`ReportingSourceWithReaderV1` — including a paginated, asynchronous, or
externally staged one — so a custom executor that needs those capabilities
runs under the service today rather than waiting for a future extension. The
inline-only knob `inlineReplayRetention` applies to `fetchSlice` adapters and
is ignored by an adapter that brings its own executor.

`reporting.install(platform)` mutates that platform object in place and
requires it to be extensible; this preserves class instances and private-field
methods that a shallow wrapper would break. It also requires the platform's
native `accounts.upsert` seam. The service cannot truthfully advertise `configuration_task:
sync_accounts` without it. That account method remains responsible for mapping
an authorized wire reporting configuration to the service's resolved input and
calling `installConfiguration`; the service does not claim a generic mapping
that the current protocol does not define.

Official configurations also pin a `finalityPolicy` (`policyId` plus `source_final` or `contractual_cutoff`). For `source_final`, set `sourceSignal` to the exact opaque signal identifier the adapter places in the manifest finality evidence's `evidenceRef`; the worker requires an exact match before irreversible official publication. `expected_at` and the wire delivery SLA use the same official deadline: the service refuses a configuration whose `officialAfterMilliseconds` disagrees with the `schedule.delivery_sla` its offering advertises, and omitting the field derives that same advertised value.

Every revision stores its rows together with an RFC 8785 JCS SHA-256 binding and exact decimal control totals for requested numeric metrics. A revision number and obligation are immutable. Official revisions are terminal; later source corrections are immutable adjustments bound to the official revision, never superseding revisions. Status snapshots omit row payloads, are capped at 8 MiB, expire after 15 minutes, and keep cursor pages stable over the flat obligation/revision/adjustment union. A periods response returns an opaque `changes_checkpoint`; echo that value verbatim as `changes_after` rather than supplying a timestamp. Account-scoped write/snapshot locks make those checkpoints gap-free for SDK store writes. The default table set is deployment-wide; use a dedicated database/schema and acknowledge that boundary explicitly. `sourceScope` must contain opaque routing identities only—never credentials or bearer tokens—because it is retained with the obligation.

`planObligations()` creates at most 1,000 obligations per call by default. Use its `account_id` and `maxObligations` options from a resumable scheduler when catching up dense or old schedules. Source executions are bounded to 10,000 objects, 1,000,000 rows, and 64 MiB per revision.

When `get_reporting_status` omits a period, the operational default horizon is the 24 hours ending at `ledger_as_of`. The `health` and `finality` arrays filter periods-view output only; they do not rewrite summary health or the underlying obligation projection.

`projectReportingObligationHealthV1` is the pure five-state projection. Before `expectedAt`, missing evidence is `waiting`; during recovery it is `delayed`; after the recovery deadline it is `action_required`; readable qualifying evidence is `healthy` for an open scope and `complete` for a closed scope. An unfiltered closed scope with no caller-owned configurations or no due periods is vacuously `complete`; an explicitly unknown configuration returns `lookup_unavailable`, and a snapshot with missing elapsed obligations fails closed. The simplified lifecycle persists deterministic issues and `reporting.status_changed` transitions, then calls only subscribers already authorized and supplied by the host.

## Consumer status ingest

The SDK is pinned to AdCP 3.2.0-rc.3 and exposes `sync_reporting_status` from the ledger subpath. Its request, response, consumer-status, obligation, issue, delivery-capabilities, and reporting-status types come from the published rc.3 schema bundle.

```ts
const syncReportingStatus = createSyncReportingStatusHandler(store, {
  // Derive this only from authenticated transport; it is never a payload field.
  resolveConsumerId: context => context.agent.agent_url,
});

const getReportingStatus = createReportingStatusHandler(store, {
  resolveConsumerId: context => context.agent.agent_url,
});
```

Existing authoritative ledgers only need the narrow
`ReportingConsumerStatusLedgerStore` port—not the producer/worker store. An
adapter supplies `listConfigurations`, `getObligation`,
`getRevisionMetadata`, `readSnapshotPage`, `getConsumerStatusBatchReplay`, and
`syncConsumerStatusBatch`. Keep the adapter over the existing authority store:
derive the internal account and durable consumer principal from authenticated
transport, authorize before every replay or read, return immutable revision
bindings, and implement current-leaf compare + append + original batch-result
replay in one transaction. Several authorized principals for one external
account must receive separate `(internal account, consumer principal)` chain
namespaces; never create a second authority store or trust either identity from
the request body.

```ts
const statusStore: ReportingConsumerStatusLedgerStore = {
  listConfigurations: accountId => existingLedger.configurations(accountId),
  getObligation: (id, accountId) => existingLedger.obligationForAuthorizedCaller(id, accountId),
  getRevisionMetadata: (id, accountId) => existingLedger.boundRevision(id, accountId),
  readSnapshotPage: (id, accountId, cursor, limit) =>
    existingLedger.authorizedSnapshotPage(id, accountId, cursor, limit),
  getConsumerStatusBatchReplay: input => existingLedger.statusBatchReplay(input),
  syncConsumerStatusBatch: input => existingLedger.compareAppendAndReplayStatusBatch(input),
};
```

Use `reportingConsumerStatusChainKeyV1`,
`reportingConsumerStatusChainKeyFromIdentityV1`,
`reportingConsumerStatusFingerprintV1`, and
`normalizeReportingConsumerStatusIdsV1` from `@adcp/sdk/reporting/ledger` when
implementing duplicate, exact-leaf, unchanged, and replay behavior. This keeps
equivalent RFC 3339 spellings in one logical chain. `readSnapshotPage` is
optional; omitting it makes seller snapshot provenance unavailable without
blocking statuses that do not claim snapshot provenance. Store failure results
use `retryAfterSeconds` (integer seconds from 1 through 3600); invalid hints and
oversized custom codes are omitted or replaced before reaching the wire.

`sync_reporting_status` is a partial-success batch. The server validates the
closed request envelope, then the handler validates every status independently.
Custom handlers should parse each item with the exported
`ReportingConsumerStatusV1Schema` from `@adcp/sdk/reporting/ledger`; the ledger
handler already does this. The framework always applies strict envelope
validation for this task—even when general request validation is `warn` or
`off`—and rejects requests above 8 MiB, 10,000 JSON nodes, or the SDK maximum
JSON depth before dispatching either the built-in or a custom handler. Results
map one-for-one to submitted statuses in request order; inspect each `result`
even when the response envelope is `completed`. Custom handlers must also
reject every duplicate ID and every entry in a duplicate logical status chain.
`recorded_at` is seller-authored and response-only.

Clock-skew, ineligible-period, and too-early missing-status failures identify
the caller-controlled field. Obligation, revision, and snapshot mismatches are
intentionally indistinguishable so consumer status ingest cannot become an
existence oracle across retained ledger objects.

Per-item failures carry an explicit recovery classification. Schema and
authorization failures are `correctable`; an exhausted transient read slot is
`RATE_LIMITED`/`transient` with `retry_after`; oversized durable statements are
`REPORTING_STATUS_TOO_LARGE`/`correctable`; and exhausted append-only store
capacity is `REPORTING_STATUS_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED`/`terminal`. The last two are
open-vocabulary AdCP extension codes, so clients must use their accompanying
`recovery` value rather than a closed code switch.

The language-neutral acceptance vectors ship at
`@adcp/sdk/compliance-fixtures/reporting-consumer-status-v1.json`. They pin
exact request bytes and SHA-256 digests, frozen clocks and principals, ordered
results, and post-operation ledger state so non-TypeScript adapters can run the
same contract without installing the SDK ledger as a second authority store.

The PostgreSQL store compares the exact current leaf for each consumer/configuration/report-definition/period chain in the same transaction that appends the new statement. An exact batch replay returns its original results; an identical status ID already recorded through another batch returns `unchanged`. Stale or omitted supersession fails without forking the chain. Periods readback includes only the authenticated consumer's history. A negative current statement—or a received statement naming a revision superseded by a later seller restatement—adds `CONSUMER_STATUS_MISMATCH` to that consumer's projection without changing seller-authored ledger evidence.

### rc.3 consumer-status hardening

`content_mismatch` is the fifth consumer status: the buyer consumed the exact
revision the seller requires and it contradicts a fact the accepted
configuration generation already fixed. It carries a required closed
`mismatch_code` (`scope_media_buy_missing`, `coverage_short`, `metric_missing`,
`schema_nonconformant`, `currency_mismatch`, `period_mismatch`) plus the
obligation id, the revision id, and the recomputed
`observed_revision_content_sha256`, so the disagreement names the exact bytes
that were read. It is **not** a measurement dispute — a buyer must not use it to
argue about how many impressions the seller counted; that is
`measurement_terms` / `makegood_policy` territory.

Not every conflict is an immediate escalation. A `received` statement made stale
*only* by a seller restatement projects the caller-scoped view as `delayed`
until a bounded re-read grace deadline, then `action_required`. The buyer read
exactly what the seller then required, so it gets one bounded chance to re-read
before the disagreement escalates. The deadline is the `created_at` of the
**first** revision that superseded the one the buyer named, plus the generation's
`schedule.delivery_sla` — or `automated_recovery_window_seconds` when that SLA is
zero, so a zero-SLA feed still yields a bounded window. Later restatements
supersede later revisions and therefore cannot restart it; a seller cannot hold
an unresolved mismatch below `action_required` by restating on a timer. Every
other conflict kind is `action_required` immediately.

`projectReportingConsumerStatusMismatchV1` is that projection as a pure
function, exported so a custom store can reuse the exact logic the built-in
handler runs. It returns the issue, the caller-scoped health it forces, and the
grace deadline when one applies.

Issues now carry `opened_at`, which is fixed at first emission and carried
unchanged across every re-emission — including across the `delayed` →
`action_required` transition, which reuses the same `issue_id` so consumers age
one work item instead of two. The SDK derives it from immutable ledger facts
(the first superseding revision's `created_at` for a stale read, the statement's
`recorded_at` otherwise) rather than from the read time, because advancing it on
re-emission would reset the escalation clock on every poll. Optional
`issue_state` (`open` / `acknowledged` only — a retired issue leaves the
projection instead of being published at `resolved` / `waived`) and
`external_ref` (inert correlation text, never dereferenced, never shared across
callers on a caller-scoped issue) round out the lifecycle.

Pass `consumerMismatchEscalation` to `createReportingStatusHandler` when the
capability document advertises `consumer_mismatch_escalation_seconds` and
`operations_contact` — the schema requires both or neither, so the escalation
always has a destination:

```ts
const getReportingStatus = createReportingStatusHandler(store, {
  resolveConsumerId: context => context.agent.agent_url,
  consumerMismatchEscalation: {
    escalationSeconds: 86_400,
    operationsContact: { email: 'reporting-ops@seller.example' },
  },
});
```

Advertise the same commitment in the capability document from that one value,
so the reads and the document cannot drift:

```ts
const escalation = {
  escalationSeconds: 86_400,
  operationsContact: { email: 'reporting-ops@seller.example' },
};

const reportingDelivery = {
  reliable_reporting_version: '1.0',
  consumer_status_task: 'sync_reporting_status',
  ...reportingConsumerStatusCapabilityV1(escalation), // consumer_mismatch_escalation_seconds + operations_contact
};

const getReportingStatus = createReportingStatusHandler(store, {
  resolveConsumerId,
  consumerMismatchEscalation: escalation,
});
```

Both entry points run the same validation, so a window with no destination — or
a `NaN` / negative one — fails at wiring time rather than silently never firing.
If you also apply the `health` query filter in a custom store, pass
`consumerMismatchEscalation` there too; the bundled `PostgresReportingLedgerStore`
takes it as a constructor option for exactly that reason.

Past `opened_at` plus that window an open mismatch is emitted at
`action_required` with a `contact_*` action naming the diagnosed responsible
party. `wait_for_retry` and `repair_access` are automation hints and neither
survives the boundary. The escalation boundary takes precedence over the
stale-received grace window when the two overlap. `operations_contact` is inert
display metadata for a human operator: agents surface it and MUST NOT fetch the
URL, send protocol traffic to it, or treat either value as a credential.

The summary view gains `obligation_counts.consumer_status_pending` whenever a
consumer principal is resolved (which is exactly when this handler advertises
`consumer_status_task`). It counts obligations whose consumer-status deadline —
`expected_at` plus `automated_recovery_window_seconds` — has passed with an
*empty* status chain for the authenticated caller. A chain with any unsuperseded
leaf counts as current whatever that leaf says. It is a visibility count over
the caller's own silence and never a health input: it does not change health,
any other count, or advertised reliability statistics, and it overlaps the
health counts rather than partitioning them.

Finally, `authoritative_party: 'consumer'` on a delivery configuration is
reserved for a buyer-deposited billing revision task that no released AdCP
version defines. `assertSupportedReportingAuthoritativeParty` refuses it with
`UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`; call it from your `sync_accounts` handler on each
requested configuration, before the generation becomes ready and before any
obligation exists. `installConfiguration` already applies it. Do not coerce the
value to `seller` — that silently installs a different contract than the buyer
asked for.

Core revisions intentionally omit feed purpose, destination, obligation, and
recipient identity. Obligations sharing the same account, report definition,
period, media-buy scope, and canonical content therefore reuse one revision,
including fan-out across direct-Core and managed-materialization consumers.

For account-local calendar periods, expand each boundary externally into an
immutable configuration generation. Do not model a local day as a constant
86,400,000 ms across daylight-saving changes. For example, the New York daily
periods `2026-03-08T05:00:00Z` → `2026-03-09T04:00:00Z` and
`2026-11-01T04:00:00Z` → `2026-11-02T05:00:00Z` use 82,800,000 and 90,000,000
milliseconds respectively. Give each generated boundary its own delivery
configuration version, set `anchor` and `installedAt` to the exact start,
`supersededAt` to the exact end, and set `periodMilliseconds` to `end - start`.
The repository-only fixture at
`test/fixtures/reporting-reconciliation/consumer-status.json` contains those
23/25-hour cases,
a calendar-month boundary, and the obligation-missing path with no invented
obligation ID.
