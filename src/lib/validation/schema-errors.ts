  //     schemas are already npm-shipped with `@adcp/sdk` and
  //     published at adcontextprotocol.org — a motivated buyer has

  //     in production, which is exactly the audience `variants[]` was

  // If a future AdCP version ever admits per-seller schema extensions
  // into the validator (today's validator only loads canonical spec
  // from `schemas/cache/<version>/`), revisit this — at that point
  // `variants[]` could start to reflect seller-internal shapes and the
