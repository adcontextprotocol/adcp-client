/**
 * Bridge between the `comply_test_controller` seed store and the
 * `createAdcpServer` spec-tool pipeline.
 *
 * Sellers who run the compliance conformance suite seed fixtures via
 * `comply_test_controller.seed_product`, but those fixtures don't flow into
 * `get_products` responses unless the seller plumbs it themselves — every
 * seller ends up rewriting the same "look up seeded products, merge into
 * handler response, dedupe, sandbox-gate" boilerplate.
 *
 * This module exposes a small declarative shape (`TestControllerBridge`)
 * that the server config accepts; when present, the dispatcher augments
 * `get_products` responses with seeded products on sandbox requests, and
 * leaves production traffic untouched.
 *
 * The bridge intentionally does NOT know how seeded products are stored.
 * Sellers provide a `getSeededProducts` callback that returns the list the
 * SDK should merge — which lets the same wiring work whether the backing
 * store is in-memory, Postgres, Redis, or a mock.
 *
 * ## Scope of verification (storyboard pass through this bridge)
 *
 * A storyboard run that succeeds because seeded fixtures were merged into
 * the response verifies **protocol conformance against fixture data**:
 * wire shape, error envelopes, idempotency, signed-request handling,
 * sandbox stamping. It does **not** verify that the seller's adapter
 * against the real upstream (e.g., social / search / programmatic
 * inventory APIs) is working — the upstream response is shadowed by the
 * post-handler merge.
 *
 * Treat this bridge as the conformance equivalent of a recorded-fixtures
 * unit test, not an end-to-end integration test. Sellers should still
 * exercise their adapters against a real (or sandbox) upstream OAuth tier
 * separately; the typical pattern is a CLI runner pointed at a deployed
 * sandbox URL with live credentials. The two together — storyboard-via-
 * bridge plus live-OAuth runner — give wire conformance and adapter
 * health respectively. See adcp-client#1775 for the cross-repo
 * coordination on making bridge participation visible in storyboard
 * run records.
 *
 * ## Adopter responsibilities
 *
 * **`resolveAccount` is the trust boundary.** The dispatcher's sandbox
 * gate is "request carries a sandbox marker AND (resolved account is
 * sandbox OR no account was resolved)." If you deploy a server with this
 * bridge registered but no `resolveAccount` configured, a buyer can stamp
 * `context.sandbox: true` on a request and trigger the merge. That's the
 * intended behavior for storyboard runners with no account scoping, but
 * means **production bindings must always configure `resolveAccount`** —
 * otherwise the buyer-supplied sandbox marker is the only gate.
 *
 * **Multi-tenant isolation is the adopter's job.** Callbacks receive
 * `ctx.account` and must key their fixture store on it. The SDK does no
 * defensive cross-check between the account on the response entries and
 * the `ctx.account` that asked for them. A sloppy session-store keying
 * can return tenant A's fixtures to tenant B; nothing in this module
 * will notice. Treat fixture stores like any other multi-tenant data
 * layer.
