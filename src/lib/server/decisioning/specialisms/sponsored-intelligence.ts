/**
 * SponsoredIntelligencePlatform — brand-agent specialism interface (v6.0,
 * protocol-keyed).
 *
 * AdCP 3.0 declares Sponsored Intelligence as a *protocol*
 * (`supported_protocols: ['sponsored_intelligence']`), not a specialism.
 * The platform field is therefore required IFF the agent declares the
 * protocol — see `RequiredPlatformsForProtocols` in `../platform.ts` and
 * the protocol-keyed branch of the dispatch validator. When AdCP 3.1 adds
 * `'sponsored-intelligence'` to `AdCPSpecialism` (tracked at
 * adcontextprotocol/adcp#3961), specialism-keyed dispatch becomes additive
 * — this interface keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * Surface: four wire tools — `si_get_offering`, `si_initiate_session`,
 * `si_send_message`, `si_terminate_session`. Maps directly onto the v5
 * `SponsoredIntelligenceHandlers` handler-bag in
 * `../../create-adcp-server.ts`.
 *
 * Session state — `req.session` convenience vs. production storage. The
 * v6 platform shape auto-hydrates a small session record onto
 * `req.session` keyed by `session_id` (resource kind `'si_session'`) —
 * intent, offering scoping, identity consent, negotiated capabilities,
 * placement provenance, terminal `acp_handoff` payload. That's the
 * minimum a fixture / mock implementation needs to resume context
 * across turns. **Production brand engines almost always own session
 * state in their own backend** (Postgres, Redis, vector store) — full
 * transcripts, RAG embeddings, tool-call logs are too rich for
 * `ctx_metadata` and easily exceed the 16KB blob cap. Treat
 * `req.session` as a convenience for fixture / mock cases and the
 * "what was the offering scope?" lookup; resolve full transcript state
 * from your own session store keyed by `req.session_id`.
 *
 * Async story: all four operations are sync at the wire level —
 * `SISendMessageResponse` has no `Submitted` arm. Long-running brand-side
 * generation (LLM inference, voice synthesis, A2UI surface assembly) is
 * absorbed within the request. Status changes between turns flow via the
 * conversational transcript itself, not via `publishStatusChange`.
 *
 * Idempotency: `initiateSession` and `sendMessage` carry
 * `idempotency_key`; the framework dispatches replays through your
 * implementation, so handle replay-safety per the spec
 * (`SISendMessageRequest.idempotency_key` documents at-most-once
 * execution semantics). `terminateSession` is naturally idempotent on
 * `session_id` and intentionally lacks an `idempotency_key`.
 *
 * Status: 6.7 (preview). Behavior frozen on AdCP 3.0 SI surface.
