   *   - `'auth_required'` — platform method threw AUTH_REQUIRED in flight.
   *
   * Treat as an open string union: future values may be added. Adopters
   * SHOULD switch exhaustively (`default: throw`) so behavior drift on
   * minor SDK bumps fails loud rather than silently no-oping.
   *
   * **In-flight only.** The refreshed token is scoped to the current
   * request — the framework does NOT echo it back to the buyer. Use this
   * for adapters that front an upstream platform API (Snap, Meta,
   * retail-media OAuth flows) where the SDK caches an upstream token
   * server-side and the buyer's auth-to-this-agent is separate.
   *
   * **Account-object identity contract.** The framework mutates
   * `account.authInfo.token` (and `expiresAt` if returned) on the Account
   * passed in. Adopters who memoize / cache `Account` objects across
   * requests MUST return a fresh copy from `accounts.resolve()` for each
   * request — sharing a cached Account would leak the refreshed token to
   * any subsequent caller that resolves the same id. Returning a new
   * object literal per call (the canonical pattern) is safe.
   *
   * **Concurrency.** `refreshToken` MUST be safe under concurrent
   * invocation on the same account — two parallel in-flight calls hitting
   * AUTH_REQUIRED at once will both call this hook. Adopters whose
   * upstream provider rate-limits refresh should coalesce internally
   * (e.g., a per-account in-flight refresh promise). The framework does
   * not coalesce.
   *
   * **Failure surfaces correctable AUTH_REQUIRED.** If `refreshToken`
   * itself throws, the framework projects to `AUTH_REQUIRED` with
   * `recovery: 'correctable'` and a fixed message (the inner exception
   * text is NOT echoed on the wire — refresh failures routinely include
   * upstream details that should not cross the trust boundary). Log inner
   * details server-side. Don't use SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE — refresh failure
   * means the upstream authorization is gone, not that the service is
   * transiently down.
   *
   * **Expiry timestamp** (`expiresAt`, ms since epoch) is optional. When
   * returned, the framework writes it to `account.authInfo.expiresAt` so
