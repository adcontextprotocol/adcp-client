/**
 * Forward-compatibility overlay for AdCP error codes the SDK pre-emptively
 * recognizes ahead of its primary `ADCP_VERSION` pin.
 *
 * Rationale.
 * - `error.code` is wire-typed `string` (open enum) per the AdCP spec — the
 *   canonical `enums/error-code.json` is documentary, and receivers MUST
 *   handle unknown codes via the `recovery` fallback.
 * - The SDK's `StandardErrorCode` union is an _affordance_ for adopters:
 *   autocomplete in `switch` blocks, typed override keys on
 *   `BuyerRetryPolicy`, exhaustive `Record<ErrorCode, …>` tables. It is NOT
 *   a wire-validity claim.
 * - In a dual-mode line (primary pin at 3.0.x GA while 3.1 ships as opt-in
 *   types under `src/lib/types/v3-1-beta/`), buyer agents will receive
 *   3.1-introduced codes from forward-rolled sellers _before_ the SDK's GA
 *   pin moves. The overlay names those codes so the SDK has a defined
 *   retry policy and a typed-error class for each, regardless of which
 *   wire version the peer speaks.
 *
 * Each entry carries `sinceAdcpVersion` so hover-docs and migration tooling
 * can tell the version story without forking the type surface.
 *
 * When the SDK's primary `ADCP_VERSION` advances to a release that includes
 * a code in this overlay, the manifest-driven table picks it up
 * automatically and the entry below becomes redundant — delete the entry in
 * the same PR that bumps the pin, then re-run `npm run generate-manifest-derived`.
 * The drift-guard test (`test/lib/standard-error-codes-drift.test.js`) will
 * fail if both surfaces define the same code with divergent metadata.
 *
