feat: rename `@adcp/client` to `@adcp/sdk` + add `/client` and `/compliance` subpath umbrellas

The library is now published as `@adcp/sdk` to reflect the three surfaces it ships — buyer-side client, server builder, and compliance harness. `@adcp/client` continues to publish from `packages/client-shim/` as a thin re-export of `@adcp/sdk` (including a CLI delegator so `npx @adcp/client@latest …` keeps working), so existing installs keep functioning without code changes. Replace `@adcp/client` with `@adcp/sdk` in your imports when convenient — APIs are identical.

New subpath exports group the surfaces so `@adcp/sdk/client`, `@adcp/sdk/server`, and `@adcp/sdk/compliance` resolve to the right slice for each use case. The root export (`@adcp/sdk`) continues to re-export the client surface verbatim, so `import { AdcpClient } from '@adcp/sdk'` and `import { AdcpClient } from '@adcp/sdk/client'` are equivalent. The new `@adcp/sdk/compliance` umbrella re-exports `testing` + `conformance` + `compliance-fixtures` + `signing/testing` for compliance harnesses that want one import path; the individual subpaths still resolve directly so callers who only need fuzzing don't pay the bundle cost of test agents.

Repo restructure: top-level `package.json` now declares an npm workspace covering `.` plus `packages/*`. The two packages stay version-linked via `.changeset/config.json` so they always release at the same number; the shim's `dependencies."@adcp/sdk"` covers the published range (`^5.22.0`) so npm dedupes consumers' trees that pull both names. (We tried `peerDependencies` first; changesets treats every minor bump on a peer as a major bump for the dependent, which would force `@adcp/client` to 6.0.0 every time `@adcp/sdk` released a feature.)
