Fix CLI --auth flag to use literal token values directly

The CLI was incorrectly setting `auth_token_env` (environment variable name) instead of `auth_token` (direct value) when the user provided `--auth TOKEN`. This caused authentication to fail with "Environment variable not found" warnings because the auth module tried to look up the literal token as an environment variable name.
