'@adcp/client': minor

Added test helpers for easy testing and self-documenting examples. New exports include `testAgent` (pre-configured MCP test agent), `testAgentA2A` (pre-configured A2A test agent), `testAgentClient` (multi-agent client with both protocols), and `createTestAgent()` helper function. Test helpers are available via `@adcp/client/testing` subpath export and provide instant access to AdCP's public test agent with no configuration required.
