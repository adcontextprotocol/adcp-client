This PR only includes documentation improvements and does not require a version bump:

- Enhanced JSDoc comments on core client classes
- Switched TypeDoc from markdown to HTML output with built-in search
- Added comprehensive API landing page (docs/API_README.md)
- Added badges to README (npm downloads, API docs, CI status)
- Fixed TypeScript type exports (BrandManifest, BrandManifestReference)
- Added documentation scripts (docs:serve, docs:open)

No library code changes that affect functionality or API surface.
