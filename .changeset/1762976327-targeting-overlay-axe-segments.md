"@adcp/client": patch
---

Added axe_include_segment and axe_exclude_segment fields to TargetingOverlay type to support AXE (Agentic eXecution Engine) segment-based audience targeting capabilities. These fields were restored in the main adcp schema (PR #193) and are now available in the client library.
